Glide
=====

_Note: This project is now **deprecated**._ :dizzy_face:

Glide adds smooth scrolling to your web projects. Just include the latest version of jQuery and the `glide.js` file to your HTML file and refresh the page! Plain and simple. Like black coffee. That stuff's the shit. [Here's a demo](http://noahbuscher.github.io/Glide/).

**Glide is mainly for testing purposes, and can become unstable. Don't use in production environments.**

Tested with:
  * Chrome
  * Internet Explorer
  * Firefox [broken]

If you're viewing on an OS X machine, Glide disables itself as Macs have a built-in smooth scroll feature, so using Glide would be redundant.
